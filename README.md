# Bird Species Recognition using Sound

This project aims to identify bird species based on their unique vocalizations using audio signal processing and machine learning techniques. The goal is to build a non-invasive and efficient method for biodiversity monitoring, ecological research, and conservation efforts.

📌 Features

- Audio feature extraction using Librosa
- Classification using Random Forest
- Accuracy evaluation with confusion matrix
- Predict species from new FLAC audio files

 📂 Tech Stack

- Programming Language: Python 3.6+
LIbraries
  - NumPy
  - scikit-learn
  - Librosa
  - Matplotlib

⚙️ System Requirements

 Software:
- Python 3.6 or above
- Windows 10

 Hardware:
- RAM: Minimum 4 GB
- Disk: 500 GB+
- Microphone: Standard

🧠 Algorithm Steps

1. Extract features from FLAC audio files.
2. Train a Random Forest Classifier.
3. Predict and evaluate model accuracy.
4. Use the trained model to predict species from new audio.

📊 Results

- Achieved high accuracy on test dataset.
- Plotted confusion matrix and prediction graphs.

 🚀 Future Scope

- Real-time deployment in parks
- Multimodal input (sound + image)
- Multi-species recognition in a single audio file
- Mobile app integration for bird shelters
